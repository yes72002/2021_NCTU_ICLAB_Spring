## Design
Lab12 Exercise  
Artificial Neural Network APRII
In this lab you are going to finish the backend flow (APR) for this design and do the power verification.

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clk | Clock. |
| rst_n | Asynchronous active-low reset. |
| IN_VALID_1 | High when ALPHA_I, A_I and D_I is valid. |
| IN_VALID_2 | High when THETA_JOINT_1, THETA_JOINT_2 and THETA_JOINT_3 is valid. |
| ALPHA_I | 洧띺洧녰: link twist |
| A_I | 洧녩洧녰: link length |
| D_I | 洧녬洧녰: offset along previous z-axis to the common normal |
| THETA_JOINT_1 | 洧랚1 [洧노洧녱]: joint angle of the first joint (angle of the first motor of the gimbal stabilizer) of time instant 洧노洧녱 |
| THETA_JOINT_2 | 洧랚2 [洧노洧녱]: joint angle of the second joint (angle of the second motor of the gimbal stabilizer) of time instant 洧노洧녱 |
| THETA_JOINT_3 | 洧랚3 [洧노洧녱]: joint angle of the third joint (angle of the third motor of the gimbal stabilizer) of time instant 洧노洧녱 |
| THETA_JOINT_4 | 洧랚4 [洧노洧녱]: joint angle of the fourth joint (angle of the fourth motor of the gimbal stabilizer) of time instant 洧노洧녱 |

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OUT_VALID | High when OUT_X, OUT_Y and OUT_Z is valid. |
| OUT_X | 洧논洧녶洧녹洧노: x-component of the position in the reference frame |
| OUT_Y | 洧녽洧녶洧녹洧노: y-component of the position in the reference frame |
| OUT_Z | 洧녾洧녶洧녹洧노: z-component of the position in the reference frame |
